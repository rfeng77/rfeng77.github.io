### Summary
This project investigates how controllability (modulated by the Learned Helplessness experiment paradigm) affects cognitive flexibility under dynamic reward conditions.  
Participants were assigned to controllable, uncontrollable, or control conditions during a noise-based learned helplessness task, then completed a voluntary task-switching paradigm without (video 1) and with reward manipulation (video 2).

### Key Findings

1. Participants under controllable noise flexibly adjusted their switching rates to reward fluctuations, whereas the uncontrollable group showed flat, reward-insensitive patterns reflecting temporal rigidity.  Additionally, Switch-rate distributions narrowed and became more uniform in the uncontrollable condition, indicating reduced variability and diminished exploratory behavior.  
2. HMM and spectral analyses revealed that uncontrollable participants remained in rigid, high-cost states and gradually lost reward sensitivity over time.  
3. Overall, uncontrollability disrupted reward-based modulation of task switching, while controllability preserved adaptive flexibility and sustained reward responsiveness.
