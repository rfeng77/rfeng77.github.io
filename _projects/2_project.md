### Summary
This project investigates how controllability (modulated by the Learned Helplessness experiment paradigm) affects cognitive flexibility under dynamic reward conditions.  
Participants were assigned to controllable, uncontrollable, or control conditions during a noise-based learned helplessness task, then completed a voluntary task-switching paradigm without (video 1) and with reward manipulation (video 2).

### Key Findings
1. **Controllability preserves flexibility:** Controllable groups adaptively modulated switching by reward, while uncontrollable groups became reward-insensitive.  
2. **Reward sensitivity declines under uncontrollability:** Over time, switching rate ceased to follow incentive changes.  
3. **Latent-state modeling:** HMM revealed transition inertia and high-cost switching in uncontrollable participants.  
4. **Cluster analysis:** Spectral profiles showed a gradual drift toward rigid, reward-insensitive clusters.  
5. **Dynamic insight:** Trial-level modeling captured the evolution from adaptive exploration to cognitive rigidity.
