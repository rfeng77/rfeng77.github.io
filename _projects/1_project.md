### Summary
This study adapted and validated the Mindful Student Questionnaire (MSQ) for use with Chinese adolescents (N = 2,910, ages 15–18). Both exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses supported a three-factor model—Mindful Attention (MATS), Mindful Acceptance (MACS), and Approach & Persistence (APS)—demonstrating high reliability (α ≈ .78–.92) and excellent model fit (CFI = 0.97, TLI = 0.97, RMSEA = 0.05). The MSQ showed strong convergent and predictive validity with the Student Subjective Well-Being Questionnaire (SSWQ), confirming its suitability for assessing mindfulness in Chinese school contexts.

### Key Findings
1. Identified a stable three-factor structure (MATS, MACS, APS).  
2. Internal consistency was high across subscales (Cronbach’s α = .78–.92).  
3. The model demonstrated excellent structural validity (CFI = 0.97, TLI = 0.97, RMSEA = 0.05, SRMR = 0.04).  
4. Predictive validity was confirmed through correlations between MSQ and SSWQ.  
5. The measure provides a culturally appropriate and psychometrically sound tool for assessing mindfulness in adolescents.
