### Summary
This study adapted and validated the Mindful Student Questionnaire (MSQ) for Chinese adolescents (N = 2,910, ages 15–18). Both exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses supported a three-factor structure—Mindful Attention (MATS), Mindful Acceptance (MACS), and Approach & Persistence (APS). The MSQ showed high internal consistency (α = .78–.92) and excellent structural validity (CFI = 0.97, TLI = 0.97, RMSEA = 0.05). It also demonstrated strong convergent and predictive validity with the Student Subjective Well-Being Questionnaire (SSWQ), indicating its reliability for measuring mindfulness and well-being in educational contexts.

### Key Findings
1. Three stable factors: Mindful Attention, Mindful Acceptance, and Approach & Persistence.  
2. Strong reliability: Cronbach’s α between .78–.92 across subscales.  
3. Excellent model fit: CFI = 0.97, TLI = 0.97, RMSEA = 0.05, SRMR = 0.04.  
4. Predictive validity confirmed: MSQ correlated positively with well-being (SSWQ).  
5. Provides a culturally adapted, reliable measure for mindfulness in Chinese students.
