**Summary.**  
This study adapted and validated the **Mindful Student Questionnaire (MSQ)** for use with Chinese adolescents (*N* = 2,910, ages 15–18). Both exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses supported a **three-factor model**—**Mindful Attention (MATS)**, **Mindful Acceptance (MACS)**, and **Approach & Persistence (APS)**—demonstrating high reliability (α ≈ .78–.92) and excellent model fit (CFI = 0.97, TLI = 0.97, RMSEA = 0.05). The MSQ showed strong convergent and predictive validity with the **Student Subjective Well-Being Questionnaire (SSWQ)**, confirming its suitability for assessing mindfulness in Chinese school contexts.

### Key Findings
1. **Three robust factors**: Mindful Attention, Mindful Acceptance, and Approach & Persistence.  
2. **High internal consistency**: Cronbach’s α between .78–.92 across subscales.  
3. **Excellent structural validity**: CFI = 0.97, TLI = 0.97, RMSEA = 0.05, SRMR = 0.04.  
4. **Predictive validity confirmed**: MSQ scores correlated with well-being on the SSWQ.  
5. **Cultural relevance**: Provides a validated mindfulness measure for Chinese adolescents.
