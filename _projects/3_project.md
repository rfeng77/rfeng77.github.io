### Summary
This project introduces a novel EEG paradigm to investigate **counter-emotion regulation**, a process in which individuals regulate their affective state by engaging an opposite-valence emotional response.  
We hypothesize that priming participants with facial expressions of opposite valence during an identity task enhances emotion-regulation efficiency, reflected in both neural (ERP) and behavioral (self-report) indices.

### Key Findings
1. The paradigm effectively captures counter-emotion regulation processes by combining priming and facial recognition tasks within each trial.  
2. Pairing facial expressions of opposite valence during the identity task increased N170 amplitudes, suggesting stronger engagement of early perceptual regulation mechanisms.  
3. Opposite-valence priming also led to more stable emotion ratings, reflecting enhanced affective control.  
4. Together, neural and behavioral results support the feasibility of this paradigm for probing priming-induced emotional regulation.

### Interpretation
Positively counter-regulating negative facial expressions during emotion identification elicited stronger early perceptual responses (N170), whereas negatively counter-regulating positive expressions produced enhanced late positive potentials (LPP).  
These findings suggest that counter-emotion priming recruits distinct regulatory neural mechanisms that buffer affective fluctuations, offering a new approach to investigating the **temporal dynamics of emotion regulation** in real time.
