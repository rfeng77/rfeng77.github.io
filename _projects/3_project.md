### Summary
This project introduces a novel EEG paradigm to investigate **counter-emotion regulation**, a process in which individuals regulate their affective state by engaging an opposite-valence emotional response.  
We hypothesize that priming participants with facial expressions of opposite valence during an identity task enhances emotion-regulation efficiency, reflected in both neural (ERP) and behavioral (self-report) indices.

### Key Findings
1.	The paradigm effectively captures counter-emotion regulation by integrating priming and facial recognition tasks within each trial. Neural and behavioral results jointly support the feasibility of this paradigm for probing priming-induced emotional regulation.
2.	Positive counter-regulation of negative facial expressions elicited stronger early perceptual responses (N170), while negative counter-regulation of positive expressions enhanced late positive potentials (LPP).
3.	These findings indicate that counter-emotion priming engages distinct regulatory neural mechanisms that buffer affective fluctuations, providing a new framework for studying the temporal dynamics of emotion regulation in real time.
