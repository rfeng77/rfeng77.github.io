### Overview
This project presents a **systematic review and meta-analysis** on how **mind–body interventions (MBIs)**—including meditation, Tai Chi, and yoga—affect **brain structure, function, and cognition** in older adults.  
Following **PRISMA guidelines** and a preregistered protocol (OSF: [10.17605/OSF.IO/QE3AM](https://osf.io/qe3am/)), we synthesized findings from **61 reports (46 RCTs)** using **structural (sMRI, DTI)** and **functional (fMRI, EEG, fNIRS, PET)** neuroimaging methods.  

The meta-analysis revealed convergent neural adaptations across **default mode (DMN)**, **frontoparietal/executive control (FPN/ECN)**, and **limbic–hippocampal circuits**, accompanied by improvements in **global cognition (g = 0.44)**, **memory (g = 0.70)**, and **depression and anxiety reduction (g ≈ 0.5)**.  
Together, these findings highlight that MBIs promote **neurocognitive resilience** and **adaptive brain–behavior coupling** during aging.

### Key Findings
1. **Neuroplasticity in aging:** MBIs consistently increased gray matter volume in the **hippocampus**, **ACC**, and **insula**, and strengthened **PCC–mPFC** and **hippocampal–DMN** connectivity supporting memory and self-regulation.  
2. **Functional network reorganization:** fMRI and EEG studies converged on increased synchronization in the **DMN** and **salience networks**, reduced P3 latency, and enhanced N2/ERN amplitudes—markers of improved attentional control.  
3. **Brain–behavior coupling:** Neural changes correlated with improvements in **MoCA**, **GDS**, **PSQI**, and **memory** scores, linking functional gains to behavioral outcomes.  
4. **Intervention-specific effects:**  
   - *Meditation* enhanced fronto-limbic regulation (DLPFC–amygdala coupling).  
   - *Tai Chi* strengthened hippocampal and motor networks linked to sleep and gait performance.  
   - *Yoga* showed right-hippocampal and occipital GMV gains but less consistent behavioral translation.  
5. **Meta-analytic outcomes:** Pooled effects confirmed significant improvements in **depression (g = 0.50)**, **anxiety (g = 0.47)**, **global cognition (g = 0.44)**, and **memory (g = 0.70)**.  
6. **Methodological insights:** Fidelity analysis revealed limited reporting and preregistration, underscoring the need for theory-driven, replicable designs in future neuroimaging RCTs.
